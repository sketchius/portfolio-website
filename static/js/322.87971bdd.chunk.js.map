This means that sometimes the robots can’t all fight at once and Soan has to be smart about\r\n\t\t\t\twhich ones to bring into each battle.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tEach robot has a handful of major modes that can be adjusted during battle to control their overall\r\n\t\t\t\tstrategy in the fight, and they also have a slew of fine-tuning settings that can be tinkered with to\r\n\t\t\t\temphasize certain behaviors. Robots are built to excel at different jobs. Some robots are better at\r\n\t\t\t\tcombat, while others are able to provide support such as repairing or recharging other robots on the\r\n\t\t\t\tteam.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tEach room represents a descrete encounter, so the player can take time to form a battle plan in terms of\r\n\t\t\t\twhich robots to use and how to configure them. Curiously, although the aliens are hostile, they are not\r\n\t\t\t\tparticularly malicious–if they win a fight, they’ll let Soan and his team flee, fully recover, and try\r\n\t\t\t\tagain.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t\t<h2>Technical Information</h2>\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>Development is using Java using Libgdx.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>The game engine and graphics engine are programmed from scratch.</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t<h3>AI</h3>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tBoth robots and aliens make decisions using an AI model built on{' '}\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm'>A* Pathfinding</a>.
